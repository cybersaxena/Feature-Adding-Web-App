# WebApp1

This web application allows IWS employee to add new "Feature Request" and display features those are added previously. First of all, the employee must be logged in the application. The default username and password goes here:

username: iws_user
password: 123

To deploy the application on AWS, it has three steps.

1) Create EC2 instance on AWS. Details are found at EC2_Instance_creation.pdf in MASTER branch.

2) Install PHP, APACHE web server, PhpMyAdmin and MySQL. Details are found at install_php_apache_phpmyadmin_mysql.pdf in MASTER branch.

3) Deploy the application is found at Deploying_WebApplication.pdf in MASTER branch. The screenshots of running application are also attached in this file.

Thank you.
